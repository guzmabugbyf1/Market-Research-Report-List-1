<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Kidney Fibrosis Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors</li><li>Pirfenidone</li><li>Renin Inhibitors</li><li>Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs)</li><li>Vasopeptidase Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The kidney fibrosis treatment market comprises several key medication types. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors aim to reduce blood pressure and decrease kidney damage. Pirfenidone is used to slow fibrosis progression. Renin inhibitors block the renin enzyme, lowering blood pressure and improving kidney function. Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs) help relax blood vessels, reducing strain on kidneys. Vasopeptidase inhibitors combine effects of ACE inhibition and neutral endopeptidase inhibition, offering a dual approach to manage fibrosis and preserve renal function.</p></p>
