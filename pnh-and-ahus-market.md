<p><h1>PNH and aHUS Market Size, Market Share and Global Market Analysis Report, 2025 - 2032</h1></p><p><strong>PNH and aHUS Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) are rare, life-threatening blood disorders. PNH is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells, leading to hemolysis, fatigue, and an increased risk of thrombosis. aHUS, on the other hand, is associated with uncontrolled complement activation, resulting in thrombotic microangiopathy, kidney injury, and potential organ failure. </p><p>The market for PNH and aHUS treatments is anticipated to experience significant growth, driven by increasing awareness of these diseases, advancements in treatment options, and a growing patient population. Key therapies, including complement inhibitors and other targeted treatments, are being developed and launched, enhancing patient management and outcomes. Additionally, ongoing research into the underlying mechanisms of these disorders is expected to pave the way for novel therapies.</p><p>The PNH and aHUS market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.9% during the forecast period. This growth trajectory reflects a robust pipeline of new medications and a strengthening healthcare infrastructure focused on rare diseases. Furthermore, the increasing incidence of these conditions and the expanding diagnostic capabilities contribute to the overall market expansion, making it a focal area for pharmaceutical investments and innovation.</p></p>
