<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SOx Scrubber System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Scrubber System</li><li>Dry Scrubber System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The SOx scrubber system market is divided into two main types: wet scrubber systems and dry scrubber systems. Wet scrubbers use a liquid solution to capture sulfur oxides from exhaust gases, effectively removing pollutants through chemical reactions and absorption. In contrast, dry scrubbers utilize adsorbent materials or calcium-based compounds to capture SOx in a dry state, minimizing water usage. Both systems are crucial in reducing sulfur emissions in industries, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations and promoting cleaner air.</p></p>
